### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**S**  in SOLID stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). SRP says that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. 

Now here one job or one responsibility doesn't mean one method in a class but that one reason that class is responsible to make change.

For example : Let's we have **AccountTriggerHandler** 

The AccountTriggerHandler class is a good example of adhering to SRP because it focuses solely on handling trigger logic for the Account object, even with multiple methods.

SRP allows for multiple methods within a class as long as those methods are focused on a single responsibility or functionality. The principle emphasizes the importance of reducing the reasons for a class to change, which improves maintainability, readability, and testability.


#### Use Case

Let's say we are making one payment application, wherein payment can be done from UPI, Netbanking or Credit Card. 

we'll implement it without SRP and with SRP. Let's do it :-)

#### Implementation without SRP

```java 
    
    public with sharing class PaymentService{

        public static void getPaymentDone(String paymentType){
            if(paymentType == 'UPI'){

                // code for UPI payment

            }else if(paymentType == 'Netbanking'){

                // code for net banking

            }else if(paymentType == 'CreditCard'){

                // code for Credit Card

            }else{
                System.debug('Cash only');
            }
        }
    }
```

In the above code block, we have if/else condition for different payment methods, tomorrow if any new payment method comes then we'll have to change the class and so on. 

Also if any block introduces any bug then entire class is at stake and need to re-test.

#### Implementation with SRP

``` java

    // common interface for all  payment method
    public interface PaymentProcessor {
        void processPayment();
    }
```

```java
    // separating implementation of each payment type
    public class CreditCardPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    
        public void processPayment() {
            // Logic for processing credit card payment
        }
    }

```

```java
    // separating implementation of each payment type
    public class NetBankingPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    
        public void processPayment() {
            // Logic for processing net banking payment
        }
    }

```

```java

    // payment service class
    public with sharing class PaymentService {
    
        /* we can use for custom metadata also for payment type and corresponding class 
        instead of map */

        private static Map<String, Type> paymentTypeMap = new Map<String, Type>{
		'CreditCard' => 'CreditCardPaymentProcessor',
		'NetBanking' => 'NetBankingPaymentProcessor'
	    };

        // calling class based on payment type
        public static void getPaymentDone(String paymentType){

            String strClassName= paymentTypeMap.get(paymentType);

            // Get the Type corresponding to the class name.
            Type classNameType = Type.forName(strClassName);
        
            // Instantiate the type.The type of the instantiated object is the interface.
            PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = (PaymentProcessor)classNameType.newInstance();
            paymentProcessor.processPayment();
        }
    }

```

In the above exmaple each payment system have their own logic to perform payment and if new payment system needs to be added in future that also can be done easily.
