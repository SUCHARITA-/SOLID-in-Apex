### Open Closed Principle (OCP)

**O**  in SOLID stands for Open Closed Principle (OCP). Which says open for extension and closed for modification.

Which broadly means that you never have to re-write any of existing code. You should only write new code possibly extending the existing code.


#### Use Case
